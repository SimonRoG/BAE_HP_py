                        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
                        <p>
                            As part of our business activities, we work together with various external bodies. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external bodies if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis permits the transfer of data. When using processors, we only pass on our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.<br>
                            The company is certified in accordance with the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF). The DPF is an agreement between the European Union and the USA that is intended to ensure compliance with European data protection standards for data processing in the USA. Every company certified under the DPF undertakes to comply with these data protection standards.

                        <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
                        <p>
                            If data processing is carried out on the basis of ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E or F GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data concerned unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR). <br>
                            If your personal data are processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for the purpose of direct marketing (objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 2 GDPR).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
                        <p>
                            You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Information, correction, and deletion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time if you have further questions on the subject of personal data.
                        </p>

                        <h3> Restriction of processing</h3>

                        <p>
                            You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time to do this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases: <br><br>

                            If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we generally need time to check this. You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data for the duration of the review. <br>
                            If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure. If we no longer require your personal data, but you require it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its erasure. <br>
                            If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. <br>
                            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or of a Member State.
                        </p>

                            Cookies are text files that contain data from websites or domains visited and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after their visit to an online service. The information stored may include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping cart or the location where a video was watched. The term "cookies" also includes other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also known as "user IDs")
                        </p>

                        <p>A distinction is made between the following cookie types and functions:</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):</b> Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed their browser
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Permanent cookies:</b> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. The interests of users that are used for reach measurement or marketing purposes can also be stored in such a cookie.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>First-party cookies:</b> First-party cookies are set by ourselves.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies:</b> Cookies can be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g., to save logins or other user input or for security reasons).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Marketing and personalization cookies:</b> Cookies are also generally used to measure reach and when the interests of a user or their behavior (e.g., viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) on individual websites are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that matches their potential interests. This process is also referred to as "tracking", i.e.,tracking the potential interests of users. If we use cookies or "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or when obtaining consent.

                        <p>
                            <b>Notes on legal bases:</b> The legal basis on which we process your personal data with the help of cookies depends on whether we ask for your consent. If this is the case, and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for processing your data is the consent you have given. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., in the business operation of our online offering and its improvement) or if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.

                            <b>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out):</b> Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke your consent or to object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). You can initially declare your objection using your browser settings, e.g., by deactivating the use of cookies (although this may also restrict the functionality of our online offering).

                            <b>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent:</b> We use a cookie consent management procedure in which the consent of users to the use of cookies or the processing and providers named in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. The declaration of consent is stored so that it does not have to be requested again, and the consent can be proven in accordance with the legal obligation. Consent can be stored on the server and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie or with the help of comparable technologies) in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information on the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: Consent may be stored for up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created and stored with the time of consent, information on the scope of consent (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system, and end device used.

                        <p>
                            Among other things, we use online conferencing tools to communicate with our customers. The individual tools we use are listed below. If you communicate with us by video or audio conference via the internet, your personal data will be collected and processed by us and the provider of the respective conference tool. The conferencing tools collect all data that you provide/enter to use the tools (e-mail address and/or your telephone number). The conference tools also process the duration of the conference, the start, and end (time) of participation in the conference, the number of participants and other "context information" in connection with the communication process (metadata). Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all technical data that is required to process the online communication. This includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs, device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera type, microphone, or loudspeaker and the type of connection. If content is exchanged, uploaded or provided in any other way within the tool, this is also stored on the tool provider's servers. Such content includes, in particular, cloud recordings, chat/instant messages, voicemails, uploaded photos and videos, files, whiteboards and other information shared while using the service. Please note that we do not have full control over the data processing operations of the tools used. Our options are largely determined by the company policy of the respective provider. Further information on data processing by the conference tools can be found in the privacy policies of the tools used, which we have listed below this text.

                        <p>
                            The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our customers (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools serves to generally simplify and accelerate communication with us or our company (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). If consent has been requested, the tools in question are used on the basis of this consent; consent can be withdrawn at any time with effect for the future.

                        <h2>8. Own services</h2>

                        <h3>How to deal with applicant data</h3>
                        <p>
                            We offer you the opportunity to apply to us (e.g., by email, post or online application form). In the following, we inform you about the scope, purpose, and use of your personal data collected as part of the application process. We assure you that your data will be collected, processed and used in accordance with applicable data protection law and all other statutory provisions and that your data will be treated in strict confidence.
                            
                        </p>

                        <h3>Scope and purpose of data collection</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you send us an application, we will process your associated personal data (e.g., contact and communication data, application documents, notes taken during interviews, etc.) to the extent that this is necessary to decide on the establishment of an employment relationship. The legal basis for this is § 26 BDSG under German law (initiation of an employment relationship), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (general contract initiation) and - if you have given your consent - Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time. Your personal data will only be passed on within our company to persons who are involved in processing your application. If the application is successful, the data submitted by you will be stored in our data processing systems on the basis of Section 26 BDSG and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Data retention period</h3>
                        <p>
                            If we are unable to make you a job offer, you reject a job offer or withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) for up to 6 months from the end of the application process (rejection or withdrawal of the application). The data will then be deleted and the physical application documents destroyed. The retention serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is apparent that the data will be required after the 6-month period has expired (e.g., due to an impending or pending legal dispute), it will only be deleted when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.<br> Longer storage may also take place if you have given your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) or if statutory retention obligations prevent deletion.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Inclusion in the applicant pool</h3>
                        <p>
                            If we do not make you a job offer, it may be possible to include you in our applicant pool. If you are accepted, all documents and information from your application will be transferred to the applicant pool in order to contact you in the event of suitable vacancies.<br> Admission to the applicant pool is based exclusively on your express consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). Giving consent is voluntary and is not related to the current application process. The data subject can withdraw their consent at any time. In this case, the data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted, provided there are no legal reasons for retention.<br> The data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted no later than two years after consent has been given.

                            We maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.<br> Social networks such as Facebook, X etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or advertising banners). Visiting our social media presences triggers numerous data protection-relevant processing operations. In detail:<br> If you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. However, your personal data may also be collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data collection takes place, for example, via cookies that are stored on your end device or by recording your IP address.<br> With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. In this way, interest-based advertising can be displayed to you inside and outside the respective social media presence. If you have an account with the respective social network, the interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or were logged in.<br> Please also note that we cannot track all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, further processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. For details, please refer to the terms of use and privacy policies of the respective social media portals.

This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on different legal bases, which must be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).

You can generally assert your rights (information, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability and complaint) both against us and against the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g., against Facebook).<br> Please note that despite the joint responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are largely determined by the company policy of the respective provider.

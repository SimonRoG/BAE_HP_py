                    A building without technology is like human body without its blood vessels and muscles: not viable. The technology in buildings represents the blood vessels and muscles of any property. It ensures that buildings are functional and includes all technical systems essential for the operation and comfort in a building. These systems not only ensure the smooth functioning in the daily life, but also significantly contribute to the efficiency, safety and environmental friendliness of buildings.

                    Today, building services engineering plays a main role in the development and renovation of buildings. While in the past, the location and the design were main priorities, now building technology has become a key pillar in the design of modern buildings in the context of sustainability. The energy has become expensive, but the sustainable building technology ensures energy efficiency and therefore low operating costs.

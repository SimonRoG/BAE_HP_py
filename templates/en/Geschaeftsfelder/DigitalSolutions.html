                    The integration of digital services and software in buildings is already playing a crucial role and is shaping the way we design, build and use buildings. Similar to the revolution in the automotive sector, where sensors, actuators and digital services are standard, buildings are also increasingly relying on these technologies to optimize their functionality, efficiency and user experience.<br><br>

                    The importance of software engineering and apps is particularly evident in the user-friendliness of buildings. Customized apps allow users to make personalized settings for room temperature, lighting and other environmental conditions. These apps, integrated into the building management system, automatically adapt to the individual preferences and habits of the building users, which not only increases comfort but also improves efficiency by adapting to the needs of the occupants. Building security is strengthened by advanced software solutions, such as biometric access control, surveillance cameras, intelligent alarm systems and the analysis of movement patterns. These digital services help to increase the security of buildings and prevent unwanted access.<br>

                    When networking buildings, not only the building itself is considered, but also the surrounding infrastructure. Here, the development of software solutions and APPS plays a key role in ensuring smooth interaction and communication between the various subsystems. Linking traditional operating data with information from different subsystems opens up new opportunities to gain comprehensive insights and design more efficient building systems. However, the real added value lies in the development of new digital services. The comprehensive analysis of the combined data enables the creation of innovative solutions, be it in the form of personalized user experiences, automatic energy optimization or intelligent space planning concepts. Digital services are based on the availability of data inside and outside the building. A building's data is an asset. Data can be used to generate additional revenue via digital services. Data and digital services can therefore significantly influence the value of a building.

                    The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning plays a central role in building automation. These technologies identify patterns in energy consumption, enable predictive maintenance and continuously optimize building management. By creating digital twins of buildings, virtual models can be synchronized with the physical buildings in real time. This facilitates monitoring, maintenance and the simulation of changes before they are physically implemented.<br><br>

                    With our Digital Solutions division, we offer comprehensive services in the field of consulting and development of building-related APPS, software and web development.

                    The conductor in an orchestra is comparable to the project manager in construction. Both
                    play a central role in coordinating and leading the team. The conductor gives it
                    time and ensures that each musician plays at the right time and at the right tempo.
                    Similarly, the project manager manages the construction project by ensuring that everyone involved
                    are coordinated and carry out their tasks in a coordinated manner.

                    Engineers, craftsmen and other specialists. Every musician brings their own skills and
                    Expertise, just as the construction experts use their unique skills to implement the

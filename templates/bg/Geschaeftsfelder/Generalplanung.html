                    Through our General Planning division, we pursue a comprehensive approach that includes the coordination and integration of all planning and construction aspects of a building project by a single general planner. The goal is to optimize the entire planning and construction process by creating a central point of contact for all concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key advantage of engaging a general planner for owners and investors lies in the efficiency and improved coordination of the construction project. Since the general planner is responsible for all planning and construction processes, potential interface problems between different trades are minimized. This helps to avoid waste of time and resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, general planning enables a holistic view of the project. The general planner coordinates not only the architecture, but also the technical, building physics, economic and scheduling aspects. This ensures optimal alignment between the various requirements and needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Owners and investors also benefit from risk reduction, as the general planner is responsible for compliance with regulations and quality standards. Through centralized coordination, potential issues can be identified early and countermeasures taken, ultimately leading to higher construction quality. Another financial advantage for owners and investors is that general planning can often lead to cost savings. By bundling the various planning and construction processes, a more efficient use of resources can be achieved. This can have a positive impact on the project budget.
                </p>

                    With our services in general planning, we offer a holistic and efficient approach to building projects. Owners and investors benefit from reduced complexity, higher construction quality and better control over the entire construction process. Our team consists of experts in architecture, technical building equipment, structural engineering, computer science and real estate-related business administration. The integration of these disciplines within a general planning team allows us to take a comprehensive approach to construction projects. The synergy effects between architecture, TGA, structural engineering, computer science and real estate business administration lead to comprehensive planning and realization of buildings that are both functionally and economically optimized. This helps to reduce complexity, minimize risks and improve the quality of the construction project.
